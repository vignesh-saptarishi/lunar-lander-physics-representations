# Gymnasium LunarLander-v3: default behavior, no randomization.
# Matches the actual behavior of LunarLander-v3 with default kwargs.
#
# Note on wind: Gymnasium's default is enable_wind=False — wind code never
# executes, even though wind_power=15.0 is set internally. Our env fork
# removed enable_wind and uses wind_power=0 for no wind. So we set
# wind_power=0.0 and turbulence_power=0.0 here to match Gymnasium's
# default BEHAVIOR (no wind), not the unused parameter values.
#
# Intent: baseline agent trained on fixed default physics. Useful as a
# control — compares against generalist agents that train with domain
# randomization across the physics space.
