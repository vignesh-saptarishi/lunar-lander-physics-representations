# physics-only-easy: Condition A (fixed vehicle, varied physics) - easy.
# Intent: test pure physics adaptation with just gravity variation.
# Vehicle fixed at gym defaults — the standard lander everyone knows.
# Only gravity varies; no wind or turbulence distractions.

# TWR constraint: comfortable. Some strong-gravity configs may be rejected
# because the fixed vehicle can't maintain TWR >= 8 at extreme gravity.
