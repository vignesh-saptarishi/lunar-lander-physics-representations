# --- Vehicle: fixed at gym defaults, except damping ---
# angular_damping varied [0,3] across all Expt E sub-conditions to raise
# difficulty uniformly — without it, fixed vehicle + one physics axis is
# too close to the default env. Damping affects rotation handling without
# confounding the world physics axis being tested.
