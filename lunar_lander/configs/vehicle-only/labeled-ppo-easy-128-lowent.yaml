# Condition B (fixed physics, varied vehicle): labeled + easy + 2x128 + lowent.
# The labeled agent sees 7 physics params — but 3 are constant (physics defaults).
# Only vehicle params vary. Labels directly describe the agent's body.
# Labeled should excel here — the labels ARE proprioceptive shortcuts.
