# Condition A (fixed vehicle, varied physics): blind + easy + 2x128 + lowent.
# The blind agent sees only kinematics + terrain (15D). Vehicle is always the
# same (gym defaults), so any behavioral inference is pure physics adaptation.
# This is the cleanest test of "can RL agents learn physics from behavior?"
