# Label corruption test: do labeled agents actually use their physics labels?
#
# Compares uncorrupted labeled agents against corruption modes:
#   zero    - set physics dims to 0 (are labels load-bearing?)
#   shuffle - permute physics dims within episode (does mapping matter?)
#   mean    - replace with training-set mean (does per-episode variation matter?)
#   noise   - add Gaussian noise sigma=0.1 (how precise must labels be?)
#
# Paths match the output of train_all_agents.py --output-base ./data/networks
