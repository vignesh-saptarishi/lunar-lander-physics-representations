# Per-axis isolation: labeled vs blind when only one physics axis varies.
# Tests whether the labeled advantage/disadvantage depends on which physics change.
#
# Requires training axis-isolated agents:
#   python lunar_lander/scripts/train_all_agents.py \
#       --batch article1-all-conditions \
#       --seeds 42,123,456,789,1024 \
#       --output-base ./data/networks
